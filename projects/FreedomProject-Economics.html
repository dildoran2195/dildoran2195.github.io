            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project: Economics</h1>
            <p>Content: Content of Freedom Project was to share my takeaways, skills, challenges, summary, EDP, product and process of my gaols in SEP. It was also about knowing how and why I am grwoing in each blog entry and to be proud of it.</p>
            <p>Context:I am a student at HSTAT in the Software Engineering Project. The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing. For my project, I chose the topic of Economics. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study Economics in order to help me make by website. Purpose of Freedom Project was to show our abilities and knowledge about bootsrap, HTML, CSS, and A-Frame. Also, purpose was to know if we are eligible to be winners of SEP10 or Honorable Mentions.</p>
<p>Challenges: One challenge that I faced was making eye contact beside the teacher in my class presentation. Also, everything was going well but I was supposed to not read off the screen during my class presentation. Therefore, 2 points were taken away from my score. However, I did my best to complete my project. One takeaway that I faced during presenting my project at expo was not talking openly b/c I was just nervous when judges came to me. Also, I did not know what the responsiveness of my project was so I think I got 2 or 1. However, I did my best to complete my project. For ex, I was not nervous when asking for help. I needed help so I raised my hand but Mr. Mueller was solving an issue for another student so he asked that student to help me out and I felt nervous about it. Another challenge & takeaways that I faced was not checking rubric for both of my expo presentation and in class presentation. Also, I did not do my slides for the in class presentation on time. However, I did my best to complete my project.
