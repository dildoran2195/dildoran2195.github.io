           <h2> Context </h2>


<p> For our SEP11 FP, I and my prtaner decided to use Babylon as our tool and Various Javascript features like arrays, objects, conditionals, loops, p5JS, etc., in order to create a medical simulation of 3D Blood analyzer along with website that explains our medical prototypes. Our goal was to improve medical technology from PAST to FUTURE instead of Past to PRESENR that develops solution to any disease related to blood or any other health related issues in healthcare system. </p>

            <h2> Content </h2>

            <p> I am so proud for successfully completing this FP in order to improve medical system through our 3D Blood analyzer. With what we acquired in class, my partner and I were able to form a freedom project related to medicine. We used p5JS to add colors and other interactive features to our website and product. However, we motsly used Javascript features like loops, arrays, functions, and conditionals to create different types of colors, sieze, inetractive teaxture, labels, and final tpuches to our 3D Blood Analyzer. Along with "How we did this FP", we also used CSS and HTML textures for final and general touches to make our website more visual, organized, and interactive. Our website explains the purpose of this project and how our solution (3D medical Simulation) solves lacking technology in medical system along with history of medical system that needs to be improved through our product. </p>

           <h2>Reflection</h2>


           <p> Challenges:I faced this challenge during Expo elevator pitch, and in-class presentation. I was not well prepared for the presentation and random questions since I was feeling so nervous but taking notes helped me to memorize most of it. I had to learn from my failure when our product and website were still lacking attractive features. Therefore, my challenge was doing my responsibility at the last minute and having trouble with collaboration during both the class and in the expo to explain why our BMVP was not as attractive as others. Also, during presentation we were not ready for random choice from Mr.Mueller in order to explain our challenges with Babylon and how it all intersects with our takeaways since it was pretty difficult to intersect Babylon with Java or anything in between since Babylon is completely different tool with combination of different features and textures.</p>


           <p> Takeaways: My takeaway was gaining skills of embracing failure and time management. Most importantly, I learned to always have a connection with my partner even though we had trouble learning from our mistakes and prioritizing time in order to practice our presentation along with doing our BMVP on time in both the class and in expo. However, this taught us to never give up by doing our assigned tasks no matter what happens to make our product and website attractive. Therefore, time management, embracing failure, communication and collaboration is always a key to success by disguising our challenges and linking them back to our takeaways during all of our presentations. Supporting each other and never giving up at any point clearly helped us to combine our mistakes in order to come up with solutions which successfully resulted in our goal along with making our friendship even stronger than before through BMVP. </p>


           <p> Next steps: I hope to use all of my experiences, challenges, takeaways, and skills for my next project in APCSP and general life. Since, I am proud to bring a new existing simulation for technologies of medicine and serve positive impacts both on my community and my future with my partner, I hope to continue a related project of medical simulation for APCSP. </p>
